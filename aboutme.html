  I am a girl who is from Woodside, NY. I will be in the 11th grade in the fall,
  and I am somewhat looking forward to stay on top of my academics and do the best i can while trying to
  study for all my major tests since the following year i will have to apply to colleges.
  I live at home with my mom and my brother. When I'm not in school, you can find me
  listening to music, with my friends at the park or going to one of my favorite organizations, SAYA.
